## Education for Understanding Social Diversity (4:05)

Education is one of the most powerful means for promoting national integration and social harmony. Schools and educational institutions help children learn about the richness of Indian diversity through curriculum, teaching methods, and co-curricular activities.

### 1. Curriculum for Diversity Awareness

The school curriculum should include topics that promote unity and constitutional values. For example:

* India’s freedom struggle teaches collective national identity.

When children learn these values early, they grow into responsible citizens who accept differences positively.

Geography education helps students learn about different states, regions, climates, resources, and lifestyles of people across India.

By understanding the uniqueness of various regions, students develop appreciation rather than prejudice. It strengthens the feeling of national unity while respecting regional identities.

### 3. Language Policy and Three Language Formula

Language is a major factor in social diversity. The **Three Language Formula** is an important educational measure to bridge linguistic gaps:

* Mother tongue or regional language
