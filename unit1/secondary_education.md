## 1. Meaning of Secondary Education (2:04:1)

Secondary education refers to the stage of education that follows primary education. After completing five years of primary education, students undergo another five years of schooling, covering **Standards VI to X**.

Students who successfully pass the **State-level public examination conducted at the end of 10th Standard** are said to have completed secondary or high school education.

The structure includes:
