# **Causes for Inequality in Education – 10 Marks Answer**

## **Introduction**

Education is a basic right of every child. But in reality, all children do not get equal opportunities for education. Many children face inequality due to social and economic reasons. The two major causes for inequality in education are:

1. **Social Discrimination**
2. **Marginalization of some social groups**

These factors prevent many children from enjoying equal access to quality education.

## **1. Social Discrimination**

### **Meaning**

Society is divided into different social groups based on:

* Caste
* Class
* Religion
* Race
* Gender

When all groups are not able to participate equally in social life, use common facilities, and share power, it is called **social discrimination**.

### **Characteristics**

* Some groups enjoy more importance and privileges
* Some groups have fewer opportunities
* Certain sections are neglected and treated as inferior

Thus, discrimination creates inequality in education.

### **‘We’ and ‘They’ Divide in Society**

In India, society is often divided into:

| Privileged Groups | Marginalized Groups |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Upper class       | Lower class         |
| Progressive       | Deprived            |
| Dominant          | Neglected           |
| More importance   | Less preference     |

Social discrimination is low in developed countries but very high in developing countries like India.

### **Ascribed vs Acquired Status**

* **Traditional system (Ascribed status):**
  Social status is based on birth. A child’s position depends on family and caste.

* **Constitutional vision (Acquired status):**
  Status should be based on talent, achievement, and performance, not birth.

The government tries to reduce inequality through policies, but discrimination still exists.

### **Educational Impact of Discrimination**

Different groups attend different types of schools:

| Caste Category        | Institution Type                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Backward classes      | Government schools              |
| Marginalized sections | Special schools                 |
| Upper class/Elite     | Private & International schools |

This results in unequal quality of education.

### **Gender Discrimination in Education**

Many parents, especially poor and uneducated, do not send girls to higher education.

Reasons:

* Preference for sons’ education
* Fear of harassment
* Schools located far away
* Early marriage of girls
* Lack of suitable subjects for girls

Consequences:

* Low enrollment of girls in colleges
* Limited career opportunities

This situation is slowly improving in urban areas.

## **2. Marginalization of Social Groups**

### **Meaning of Marginalization**

Marginalization is a process where powerful groups push certain people out of mainstream society. These groups are treated as unwanted and excluded from social and cultural life.

Peter Leonard defines marginality as:

“Being outside the main stream of productive activity.”

Marginalized people face:

* Economic backwardness
* Social disrespect
* Denial of rights
* Educational deprivation for generations

---

## **Marginalized Children**

Children who grow up in socially neglected and oppressed families are called **marginalized children**.

### **Characteristics**

Marginalized children often:

* Lack learning facilities
* Suffer from malnutrition and poor health
* Do not get proper medical care
* Live in remote or unhygienic areas
* Are forced into child labour
* Have illiterate parents
* Face poverty and unemployment
* Lack role models in society

---

## **Vicious Circle**

Marginalized children remain trapped in an inter-generational cycle of:

* Poverty
* Ignorance
* Social exclusion
* Educational backwardness

---

## **Conclusion**

Thus, inequality in education is mainly caused by social discrimination and marginalization. To achieve educational equality, society must remove caste, gender, and economic barriers and ensure inclusive, quality education for all children.
