### Education to Eliminate Social Inequalities

*(Exam-Ready Teacher Style Answer – 10 Marks, ~600 Words)*

Education is widely regarded as the most powerful instrument for social transformation. It is often called **“the great equalizer”** because it helps reduce disparities caused by caste, class, gender, religion, region, and economic status. Social inequalities weaken national unity and prevent inclusive development. Therefore, education plays a central role in eliminating social inequality by providing equal opportunities, empowering marginalized groups, and promoting social justice.

To achieve an egalitarian society, several comprehensive educational measures are necessary.
