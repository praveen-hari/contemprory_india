The **Fundamental Rights** are the basic human freedoms guaranteed to every citizen of India by the Constitution. These rights are essential for the proper and harmonious development of an individual’s personality. They ensure equality, liberty, justice, and dignity for all citizens. Fundamental Rights are enforceable by the courts, and any citizen whose rights are violated can seek remedy through the judiciary.
