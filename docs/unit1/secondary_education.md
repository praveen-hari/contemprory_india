## 1. Meaning of Secondary Education (2:04:1)

Secondary education refers to the stage of education that follows primary education. After completing five years of primary education, students undergo another five years of schooling, covering **Standards VI to X**.

Students who successfully pass the **State-level public examination conducted at the end of 10th Standard** are said to have completed secondary or high school education.

The structure includes:

* Standards VI, VII, VIII (Lower Secondary Classes)
* Standards IX and X

Middle schools include Standards VI to VIII along with primary classes. High schools and higher secondary schools offer the full secondary section.

After completing secondary education, students can choose among:

* Two-year Higher Secondary Course (XI & XII)
* Two-year Industrial Trade Certificate (ITI) course
* Three-year Diploma Course in Polytechnics

Thus, secondary education serves as a bridge between school life and practical life in the community.

## 2. Importance of Secondary Education (2:04:2)

Secondary education is important for several reasons:

Proper guidance at this stage ensures balanced personality development.

Primary school teachers are selected from those who have completed secondary education and undergone teacher training. Thus, secondary education forms the base for teacher education.
