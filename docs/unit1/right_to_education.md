The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009 is a landmark legislation in the history of Indian education. It transformed elementary education from a Directive Principle into a Fundamental Right. The Act reflects the commitment of the Indian Constitution towards universal, equitable, and quality education for all children.

## 1. Background of Enacting the RTE Act, 2009 (3:07:1)

At the time of the adoption of the Indian Constitution in 1950, **Article 45** under the Directive Principles of State Policy stated that:

> “The State shall endeavour to provide free and compulsory education for all children until they complete 14 years of age.”

However, since Directive Principles are not legally enforceable, Article 45 remained only a direction and not a constitutional obligation. As a result, universal elementary education could not be fully achieved for several decades.

To give legal status and enforceability to this provision, the **86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002** inserted **Article 21A** into the Constitution. According to Article 21A:

> “The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.”

Thus, education became a **Fundamental Right**.

Following this amendment, the Parliament passed the **Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act on 4th August 2009**, and the Act came into force on **1st April 2010**, along with the necessary rules for implementation.
