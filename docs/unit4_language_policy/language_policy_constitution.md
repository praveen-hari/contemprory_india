## **Introduction**

India is a multilingual country with great linguistic diversity. To maintain unity while respecting diversity, the framers of the Constitution made detailed provisions regarding language. Articles **343 to 351** of the Indian Constitution clearly explain the language policy of the country. These Articles deal with the official language of the Union, State languages, language in courts, protection of linguistic minorities, and promotion of Hindi.

## **Article 343 – Official Language of the Union**

Article 343 declares that:

* **Hindi in Devanagari script** shall be the official language of the Indian Union.
* The international form of Indian numerals shall be used.

However, English was allowed to continue for official purposes for **15 years** from the commencement of the Constitution (i.e., until 1965). Parliament was given the power to allow the continued use of English even after this period. Due to opposition from non-Hindi speaking states, English continues as an **Associate Official Language**.

## **Article 344 – Commission and Parliamentary Committee**

Article 344 provides for the appointment of:

* A **Commission on Official Language** by the President after five years and then after ten years.
* A **Parliamentary Committee** consisting of 30 members (20 from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha).

The Commission recommends:

* Progressive use of Hindi
* Restrictions on English
* Language for communication between Union and States
* Form of numerals

While making recommendations, the Commission must protect the interests of non-Hindi speaking people.

## **Article 345 – Official Language of the State**

This Article gives freedom to State Legislatures to adopt:

* Any one or more languages used in the State, or
* Hindi,

as the official language of the State.

Until such law is made, English may continue for official purposes in the State.

## **Article 346 – Communication Between States**

The language authorized for official use in the Union (Hindi or English) shall be used for communication:

* Between one State and another
* Between a State and the Union

However, if two States agree, they may use Hindi for communication between them.

## **Article 347 – Recognition of Language of a Section**

If a substantial proportion of people in a State demand recognition of their language, the President may direct that the language be officially recognized in that State or a part of it.

This protects linguistic minorities.

---

## **Article 348 – Language of Supreme Court and High Courts**

Until Parliament decides otherwise:

* All proceedings in the Supreme Court and High Courts shall be in **English**.
* All Bills, Acts, Ordinances, and legal documents shall be in English.

A State Governor may permit Hindi or another official State language in High Court proceedings with the President’s consent, but judgments must remain in English.

## **Article 350 – Right to Submit Grievances**

Every citizen has the right to submit representations for redress of grievances in:

* Any language used in the Union or
* Any language used in the State.

This ensures linguistic freedom.

## **Article 350-A – Mother Tongue at Primary Stage**

States must provide facilities for instruction in the **mother tongue at the primary stage** for children belonging to linguistic minorities. The President may issue directions to ensure this.

---

## **Article 350-B – Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities**

The President appoints a **Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities** to:

* Investigate safeguards for linguistic minorities
* Submit reports to the President
* Present reports before Parliament

---

## **Article 351 – Development of Hindi**

Article 351 directs the Union Government to promote and develop Hindi so that it becomes a medium of expression for India’s composite culture. Hindi should be enriched by drawing vocabulary mainly from Sanskrit and other Indian languages.

---

## **Conclusion**

Thus, the Indian Constitution provides a balanced language policy. It declares Hindi as the official language while allowing English to continue. It protects State languages and linguistic minorities and ensures mother tongue education at the primary level. Through Articles 343 to 351, the Constitution promotes unity in diversity and safeguards the linguistic rights of all citizens.
