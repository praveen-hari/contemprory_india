# **Language Policy in India: Pre-Independent and Post-Independent Period – 10 Marks Answer**

## **Introduction**

Language plays a very important role in education and national integration. India is a multilingual country, and the question of which language should be used in education has always been a major issue. The language policy in India underwent significant changes during the British period and after independence.

# **Language Policy During Pre-Independent Period**

## **Pre-1835 Situation**

Before 1835, India did not have a centralized educational system under British rule.

* Regional languages were used as the medium of instruction in traditional street schools and pathshalas.
* English schools were established mainly for the children of British officers.
* The common people continued education through vernacular languages.

## **1. Macaulay’s Minute (1835) – Downward Filtration Theory**

A major turning point came with **Macaulay’s Minute of 1835**.

Macaulay aimed to create:

> “A class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste and intellect.”

### **Key Features**

* English education was provided only to a small elite group.
* The educated Indians would act as interpreters between the British rulers and the masses.
* English became the medium of instruction in schools under the East India Company.

This policy promoted English but neglected Indian languages.

## **2. Wood’s Despatch (1854)**

Wood’s Despatch is called the “Magna Carta of Indian Education.”

### **Recommendations**

| Level             | Language Policy              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Primary Education | Vernacular languages allowed |
| Higher Education  | English medium continued     |

It recognized the importance of mother tongue at primary level but strengthened English in higher education.

## **3. Hunter Commission (1882)**

The Hunter Commission recommended that:

* Primary education should be given through **mother tongue or vernacular languages**.
* Students should be allowed to learn in their own language.

This policy continued until independence.

## **Impact on Indian Leaders**

Many leaders like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Nehru, Gandhi, Tagore, and Vivekananda studied through English, which influenced their views on modern education.

---

# **Language Policy in Post-Independent India**

## **Language Problem After Independence**

After independence, English was the official language. But different states demanded that their regional language should be:

* State language
* Administrative language
* Medium of instruction

This created tension known as the **language problem**.

### **Major Issues**

1. Medium of instruction
2. Link language (Hindi or English)
3. Language load on students
4. Place of classical languages like Sanskrit and Arabic

---

## **Major Changes After Independence**

### **Mother Tongue as Medium**

Mother tongue or regional language was accepted as the medium of instruction at school level. Basic Education policy supported learning through mother tongue.

---

### **Hindi as Official Language**

Hindi in Devanagari script was declared the official language of the Union. English was allowed as an associate official language for 15 years.

---

## **1965 Language Crisis**

When Hindi was declared the sole official language in 1965, anti-Hindi agitations occurred, especially in Tamil Nadu. Prime Minister Nehru assured that English would continue as long as non-Hindi states wanted it.

---

## **Three Language Formula (1956)**

To solve the language issue, the Three Language Formula was introduced.

### **Formula**

* Non-Hindi areas: Mother tongue + Hindi + English
* Hindi areas: Hindi + English + another modern Indian language

### **Difficulties**

* Heavy curriculum burden
* Resistance to Hindi in some states
* Lack of teachers and facilities

---

## **Kothari Commission (1964–66)**

The Kothari Commission suggested a Modified Three Language Formula with flexibility and stated that no student should be forced to learn four languages.

---

# **Conclusion**

Thus, language policy in India evolved from British promotion of English to post-independence efforts to balance mother tongue, Hindi, and English. Though challenges remain, India’s language policy reflects unity in diversity and aims to promote national integration through education.
