# **Types of Social Inequality – 10 Marks Answer**

## **Introduction**

Even after independence, India still faces many forms of social inequality. Though democracy promises equality, different groups of people continue to experience unequal treatment in society.

Some major realities in post-independence India are:

* Not all citizens participate equally in democracy
* Economic policies often favour the rich
* Weaker sections still lack equal opportunities
* Power-sharing is not strong at all levels
* Citizens are not treated equally in practice

Social inequality exists in many forms. The major types are:

1. Caste-based inequality
2. Gender-based inequality
3. Class-based inequality
4. Regional inequality

# **1. Caste-Based Social Inequality**

### **Meaning of Caste**

Caste refers to social groups formed based on birth.

Sociologists define caste as:

* **H. Cooley:** “Caste is the lifestyle and practices strictly followed by a social group.”
* **Bogley:** “Castes are hierarchically arranged groups based on heredity.”

### **Characteristics of Caste System**

* Each caste has its own customs and rules (*Kula Dharma*)
* Marriages happen within the same caste (endogamy)
* Occupations are hereditary
* The system became rigid over time based on the four varnas

### **Caste Inequality**

Caste-based inequality means some castes enjoy more privileges while others are denied opportunities.

Jawaharlal Nehru called caste system:

**“The cancer afflicting Indian society.”**

Low castes face discrimination in education, employment, and social mobility.

### **Solutions**

* Reservation system in education and jobs
* Empowerment through self-confidence and hard work
* Promoting inter-caste marriages to break caste barriers

# **2. Gender-Based Inequality**

### **Meaning**

Gender inequality arises due to sexism—discrimination between males and females.

Gender discrimination occurs in:

* Family
* Schools
* Workplaces
* Public spaces
* Politics

### **Manifestations**

#### **In Education**

* Girls’ enrollment is lower than boys
* Drop-out rate is high
* Limited access to professional courses
* Sexual harassment in institutions

#### **In Employment**

* Fewer women in top posts
* Wage gap exists even for same work
* Restrictions on certain jobs like army, pilots, heavy vehicle driving

#### **In Politics**

* Women representation in parliament and assemblies is very low
* Women ministers rarely get powerful portfolios

### **Positive Development**

Many states have reserved **30%–50% seats** for women in local bodies like Panchayats, improving empowerment.

# **3. Class-Based Inequalities**

### **Origin of Class System**

With civilization, different occupations developed. People were divided based on:

* Income
* Skills
* Education
* Profession

### **Three Main Classes**

| Class        | Composition                      | Features                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| High Class   | Industrial owners, top officials | Control resources         |
| Middle Class | Professionals, executives        | Educated group            |
| Lower Class  | Labourers, manual workers        | Low income, less educated |

Class inequality creates divisions such as:

* Rich vs Poor
* Educated vs Illiterate
* Haves vs Have-nots

### **Role of Education**

Education acts as a **social leveller** by improving skills and enabling upward mobility.

### **Steps to Reduce Class Inequality**

* Vocational training
* Loans for poor entrepreneurs
* Higher taxes on rich
* Labour reforms
* Encouraging entrepreneurship

---

# **4. Regional Inequality**

### **Unequal Development Across States**

All states are not equally developed. Differences exist in:

* Electricity generation
* Transport facilities
* Education and health services
* Employment opportunities
* Per capita income

### **Urban–Rural Divide**

Even within the same state:

* Cities have many facilities
* Remote villages lack basic educational opportunities

Example:

* Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh → Educationally backward
* Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra → Educationally advanced

### **Key Observations**

* Huge regional disparities exist
* Educational expansion and job creation are urgently needed
* Poverty eradication is essential to reduce inequality

---

# **Conclusion**

Thus, social inequality in India exists due to caste, gender, class, and regional differences. To achieve true equality, coordinated efforts are needed from village level to national level. Education, empowerment, and inclusive development are the best tools to build a just society.
