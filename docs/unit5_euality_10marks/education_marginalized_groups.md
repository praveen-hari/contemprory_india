### Education for the Marginalized Groups

*(Exam-Ready Teacher Style Answer – 10 Marks, ~600 Words)*

Education is a powerful instrument for social equality and national development. In every society, certain groups remain deprived of opportunities due to social, economic, cultural, or physical disadvantages. These groups are known as **marginalized groups**. Education plays a vital role in empowering them, improving their status, and bringing them into the mainstream of society.

## 1. Global Recognition of Marginalization

The term **“Marginalized Group”** was first used in France and later gained worldwide recognition. Today, educationists, psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, and economists widely use the term to describe socially excluded groups.

Marginalization is considered an inhuman social practice because it denies dignity, rights, and opportunities to certain sections of people.

## 2. Meaning of Marginalized Social Group (7:11:01)

Marginalization refers to the process of excluding one or more groups of people, who are perceived by dominant social groups as:

* Not important
* Powerless
* Without useful social function

Such groups are made to accept their inferiority, which leads to social exclusion.

According to **Peter Leonard**,

> “Marginality is being outside the main stream of productive activity.”

Marginalization is thoroughly demeaning and affects:

* Economic wellbeing
* Human dignity
* Physical security
* Social status

Marginalized groups often form separate identities and unity for self-protection against discrimination.
