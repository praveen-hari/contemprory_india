# **Four Pillars of Education as Viewed by Delors Commission Report – 10 Marks Answer**

## **Introduction**

Education is not only meant for passing examinations or getting a job. It is essential for the complete development of an individual and society. In 1996, the UNESCO-appointed **Delors Commission** submitted an important report titled **“Learning: The Treasure Within.”**

The Commission stated that education should help every person develop fully and live peacefully with others. To achieve this, it proposed **Four Pillars of Education**, which provide a holistic framework for lifelong learning.

These four pillars are:

1. Learning to Know
2. Learning to Do
3. Learning to Live Together
4. Learning to Be

# **1. Learning to Know**

### **Meaning**

Learning to Know means **“learning how to learn.”** It focuses on developing cognitive abilities such as:

* Concentration
* Memory
* Thinking skills

Every individual has hidden talents like reasoning, imagination, communication, and aesthetic sense. Education should help bring out these abilities.

### **Key Skills**

#### **a) Concentration Skills**

From childhood, students must learn to concentrate on objects, people, and tasks. This can be developed through:

* Games
* Practical science activities
* Work experience
* Travel and exploration

#### **b) Memory Skills**

Memory is important to counter the overload of instant information. Human memory is better than machines because it creates meaningful connections. Students should learn selectively, with understanding, and traditional memorization should not be completely removed.

#### **c) Thinking Skills**

Thinking develops first at home and later through teachers. Schools must encourage:

* Practical problem-solving
* Abstract thinking
* Inductive and deductive reasoning
* Scientific method and laboratory learning

### **Summary**

Learning to Know prepares students to acquire knowledge independently and become enlightened, empowered individuals.

# **2. Learning to Do**

### **Meaning**

Learning to Do refers to **applying knowledge in practice.** Education should not remain theoretical but must develop competency and skills required for real life.

### **Competency Development**

Competency is assessed through:

* Skills and talents
* Social behavior
* Self-initiative
* Willingness to work hard

This pillar is closely related to **interpersonal or soft skills**, which are essential in the modern service-based economy.

### **Important Skills**

* Communication skills
* Problem-solving ability
* Adaptability
* Leadership qualities
* Social responsibility
* Teamwork and group functioning
* Life skills for daily living

### **Summary**

Learning to Do enables students to use knowledge effectively, work with others, make decisions, and face challenges confidently.

# **3. Learning to Live Together**

### **Meaning**

Learning to Live Together means developing the ability to live in peace and harmony with others. It involves internalizing social values and practicing them throughout life.

### **Core Values**

* Respect and concern for others
* Unity among people of different caste, religion, language, gender, and culture
* Cooperation and non-violence
* Acceptance of diversity
* Understanding mutual interdependence

### **Two Approaches**

#### **Approach 1: Discovering Human Diversity (Early Childhood)**

Teachers should help children understand similarities and differences among people. Subjects like:

* History
* Geography
* Literature
* Citizenship education
* Religious studies

promote awareness of diversity.

#### **Approach 2: Community Projects (Age 10–12 onwards)**

Students should participate in common social projects such as:

* Social service
* Slum renovation
* Helping senior citizens
* Literacy programs
* Environmental awareness
* Human rights campaigns
* AIDS and drug abuse prevention

### **Summary**

This pillar develops social responsibility, cooperation, and peaceful coexistence.

# **4. Learning to Be**

### **Meaning**

Learning to Be refers to the **complete development of the whole person.** Every child is unique and education must nurture individual potential.

### **Holistic Development**

Education should develop:

* Body (physical growth)
* Mind (intellectual development)
* Spirit (emotional and moral strength)

### **Key Outcomes**

* Independent and critical thinking
* Sound judgement
* Decision-making ability
* Physical and mental health
* Unique personality development

### **Summary**

Learning to Be helps individuals become well-rounded, confident, and self-reliant human beings.

# **Conclusion**

The Four Pillars of Education suggested by the Delors Commission provide a complete vision of education. Together they help individuals:

* **Know** – acquire knowledge
* **Do** – apply knowledge
* **Live Together** – maintain harmony
* **Be** – develop fully as human beings

Thus, education should aim at creating responsible, skilled, peaceful, and holistic individuals for a better society.
