# **Funding Pattern of SSA**

SSA follows a Centre-State sharing pattern:

| Plan Period  | Centre Share | State Share |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| IX Plan      | 85%          | 15%         |
| X Plan       | 75%          | 25%         |
| After X Plan | 50%          | 50%         |

This progressive funding ratio shows increasing responsibility of State Governments over time.

---

## **Fund Release Mechanism**

* Central Government releases funds directly to the State Implementation Society.
* Further installments are released only after:

  * State transfers its share.
  * At least 50% of funds have been utilized.

---

## **Decentralization of Funds**

Funds for maintenance and teaching materials are transferred to:

* Village Education Committees
* School Management Committees
* Gram Panchayats

This ensures community participation and transparency.

---

## **Scheme Convergence**

Most elementary education schemes were merged into SSA after the IX Plan. However:

* Mahila Samakhya
* National Bal Bhawan
* NCTE
* Mid-Day Meal Scheme

continued separately.

---

## **Conclusion**

Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is a landmark programme that significantly improved access, equity, and quality in elementary education in India. By focusing on infrastructure, teacher development, inclusion, and shared funding responsibility, SSA has contributed greatly to achieving the goal of **Education for All**. It laid the strong foundation for a literate and empowered India.
