# **Universalisation of Primary Education – 10 Marks Answer**

## **Introduction**

Education is the foundation for national development and social progress. The Government of India has given high priority to providing elementary education to all children. The concept of **Universalisation of Primary Education (UPE)** aims to ensure that every child receives free and compulsory schooling. It is one of the most important goals of Indian educational planning.

# **Meaning of Universal Primary Education**

Universalisation of Primary Education means providing **free and compulsory education** to all children between the age group of **6 to 14 years**.

It ensures that:

* Every child is enrolled in school
* Every child attends school regularly
* Every child completes primary education without dropping out

### **Constitutional Basis**

Article 45 of the Indian Constitution states:

> “It is the endeavour of the State to provide free and compulsory education to all children from age 6 to 14 within 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution.”

Thus, achieving universal elementary education is the constitutional duty of both Central and State governments.

# **Key Implications of Universalisation**

Universalisation includes four important aspects:

1. **Free Education**
   Primary education for eight years should be free for all children.

2. **Compulsory Enrollment**
   All children should be admitted in Class I at the proper age.

3. **Compulsory Attendance**
   Children aged 6–14 must attend school regularly.

4. **Universal Retention**
   Children admitted in Class I should be retained till they complete Class VIII.

# **Challenges in Achieving Universal Primary Education**

Though the goal was originally set for 1960, it was repeatedly postponed due to many difficulties. Major challenges are:

### **1. Economic Factors**

Poverty forces children to work as domestic servants or labourers to support family income.

### **2. Ignorance of Parents**

Uneducated parents fail to realize the importance of schooling and do not send children to school.

### **3. Communal and Ethnic Barriers**

Tribal groups, minorities, and backward communities often remain outside the formal education system.

### **4. Social and Religious Practices**

Certain cultural restrictions prevent girls from attending school after puberty.

### **5. Geographical Barriers**

Children living in hilly, drought-prone, or remote villages face difficulty due to lack of nearby schools.

### **6. Educational Reasons**

Problems of **wastage and stagnation** occur when education becomes uninteresting, leading to high dropout rates.

### **7. Paucity of Funds**

State governments often lack sufficient funds for opening new schools and improving infrastructure.

### **8. Administrative Lapses**

Poor management and low quality in government schools encourage parents to prefer private schools.

### **9. Individual Problems**

Mentally challenged or emotionally disturbed children may not adjust in normal schools.

### **10. Population Explosion**

The growing child population increases the demand for schools, teachers, and financial resources, making universal education a mammoth task.

Thus, universal education cannot be achieved through formal schooling alone. Non-formal education must also play a role.

# **Efforts Taken to Achieve Universal Primary Education**

The government has taken many measures to promote UPE:
