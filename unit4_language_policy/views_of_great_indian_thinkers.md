# **1. Rabindranath Tagore’s Views**

Rabindranath Tagore believed that education should be based on **creativity, freedom, and natural learning**.

### **Mother Tongue at Primary Stage**

Tagore strongly supported the use of **mother tongue as the medium of instruction** at the primary level. According to him:

* Children learn best in their own language.
* Education should be linked with manual work and real-life experiences.

### **Subjects and Activities**

Tagore suggested that primary education should include:

* Language and literature
* Geography and natural science
* Music and fine arts

He encouraged creative activities like:

* Dance, drama, drawing, painting
* Gardening and handicrafts

### **Individual Development**

Tagore emphasized that every child has special talents. Education should nurture these talents in a free environment. Providing the same education to all children, without considering individuality, is harmful.

### **Higher Education and International Outlook**

While mother tongue should be the medium at the primary stage, Tagore believed students at higher levels should learn languages of their choice. At Shantiniketan and Visva Bharati University, he arranged teaching of:

* Western languages: English, French, German
* Oriental languages: Hindi, Bengali, Chinese, Sanskrit

He promoted international brotherhood through institutions like **China Bhavan** and **Hindi Bhavan**.

# **2. Mahatma Gandhi’s Views**

Mahatma Gandhi strongly opposed English as the medium of instruction at school level. He believed that education should be rooted in Indian languages and culture.

### **Mother Tongue as Medium**

Gandhiji insisted that the **mother tongue of the child must be the medium of instruction**, because:

* It develops clear understanding
* It preserves Indian culture
* It avoids alienation from society

### **Basic Education (Nai Talim)**

Gandhiji introduced the concept of **Basic Education**, where craft plays a central role.

He believed:

* Craft should not be just another subject.
* All subjects should be taught through the chosen craft.

This approach supports **learning by doing**, not rote memorization.

### **Salient Features of Basic Education**

* Free and compulsory education for children aged 7–14
* Education through productive craft
* Self-supporting education
* Simple cooperative community life
* Strong moral and religious training
* Mother tongue as medium of instruction

Thus, Gandhi’s language policy was closely connected with his vision of self-reliant and practical education.

### **Curriculum and Subjects**

### **Mother Tongue in Primary Education**

Vivekananda supported mother tongue as the medium at the primary stage. He also stressed the need for:

* Industrial training units

He emphasized combining oriental knowledge (Vedanta, philosophy) with Western science and technology.
